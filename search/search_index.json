It's the perfect raspberry leather with a really smooth and non-obnoxious oud. Very unisex, moderate projection, good sillage, good longevity.

The initial impression is bracing and fresh, but as it dries down, the castoreum note is just too animalic for me. I might try this again just to see, but on a day when I don't have to see anyone else.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Bianco%20Latte/","title":"Bianco Latte","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Bianco%20Latte/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>This smells like a fresh stroopwafel, and honestly who doesn't want to smell like that?

Perfect cozy scent</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Cape%20Heartache/","title":"Cape Heartache","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Cape%20Heartache/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>So, this is a synthetic strawberry and it definitely has LipSmackers vibes, but I honestly love the nostalgia. Coupled with the evergreen notes, this takes me to summer in a cabin as a kid, especially as it dries down into something like the smell of pine needles in the sun.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Delizia%20Oscura/","title":"Delizia Oscura","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Delizia%20Oscura/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>I sampled this one in my quest for the perfect violet perfume, and while the violet is definitely there, it's a really gorgeous chocolate-hazelnut-violet, described as a tribute to the elegance of Italy. This is a room filler and it lasts for hours. Complex and non-linear</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Do%20Son/","title":"Do Son","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Do%20Son/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>A good spring scent\u2014very tuberose-forward, kind of a honeyed white floral (not funerary), and the pink pepper keeps it sparkly.

It's cool, delicate, watery, with a balanced rose heart. I was worried the patchouli note would ruin it on the dry-down, but the cashmeran and benzoin carry it. In contrast to Eau Rose this is less exuberant. Instead of being in the midst of a rose garden in full bloom, this perfume is in the shade next to a koi pond with roses in the background.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Eau%20Rose/","title":"Eau Rose","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Eau%20Rose/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Another photorealistic EDP\u2014intense, fresh roses, with the green of the garden to keep it grounded.

Cottagecore (in a positive way) and versatile for cool or warm weather. Moderate projection, sillage, and longevity. A top 3 scent for me</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Jazz%20Club/","title":"Jazz Club","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Jazz%20Club/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>Beautifully smoky and a little boozy without feeling overpowering.

It dries down to a more conventional warm vanilla (not boozy or candied) after about an hour. Good longevity, mild projection and sillage.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Liquide%20Gold/","title":"Liquide Gold","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Liquide%20Gold/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>Supposed to represent the Tarot figure of the Star pouring water from a silver pitcher into a gold one.

Tragically, a limited edition.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Novacaine/","title":"Novacaine","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Novacaine/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>This smells like incense in the best way possible. The blossom and ginger are very fleeting, so the dry-down is pure spicy, vanilla, frankincense. There aren't any smokey notes listed, but it has that kind of vibe. Not as good for a workday scent, but really nice in cooler weather as an evening fragrance.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Panda/","title":"Panda","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Panda/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>I'm really on the fence about this one. It's such a sharp, intensely green scent for the first hour, then fades out into a softly animalic vanilla. I wish the apple were slightly more prominent without teetering into cleaning solution smells. I might try this again in warmer weather when the sharpness can cut through the humidity.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Perfume%20Sample%20Template/","title":"Perfume Sample Template","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Perfume%20Sample%20Template/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>Description here</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Fragrances/Philosykos/","title":"Philosykos","text":""},{"location":"Fragrances/Philosykos/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>Technically a \"green\" EDP, but pulls more fruity.

Floral but not too floral, sparkly from the pink pepper, with a warmth from the ambrox. Low projection and sillage, but medium longevity (solid perfume form)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""}]}
