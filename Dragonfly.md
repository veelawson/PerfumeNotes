## Description
- Someone described this as being in a Monet water lilies painting, and that is exactly it. It's cool, delicate, watery, with a balanced rose heart. I was worried the patchouli note would ruin it on the dry-down, but the cashmeran and benzoin carry it. In contrast to [Eau Rose](Eau%20Rose.md) this is less exuberant. Instead of being in the midst of a rose garden in full bloom, this perfume is in the shade next to a koi pond with roses in the background.
