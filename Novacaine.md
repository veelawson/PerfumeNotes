## Description
- This smells like incense in the best way possible. The blossom and ginger are very fleeting, so the dry-down is pure spicy, vanilla, frankincense. There aren't any smokey notes listed, but it has that kind of vibe. Not as good for a workday scent, but really nice in cooler weather as an evening fragrance.
