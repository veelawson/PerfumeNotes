## Description
- I'm really on the fence about this one. It's such a sharp, intensely green scent for the first hour, then fades out into a softly animalic vanilla. I wish the apple were slightly more prominent without teetering into cleaning solution smells. I might try this again in warmer weather when the sharpness can cut through the humidity.
